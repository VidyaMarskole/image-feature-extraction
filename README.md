# image-feature-extraction
Overview
This Python script provides a comprehensive visualization of various image features and processing techniques. It displays 20 different feature visualizations in a single interactive plot, making it useful for computer vision tasks, image analysis, and educational purposes.

Features
The tool visualizes the following image features:

Basic Visualizations

Original image

Color histogram (RGB channels)

HSV color space

LAB color space

Canny edge detection

Feature Detection

Harris corner detection

Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture

GLCM contrast for texture analysis

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

Gabor filter response

Edge and Shape Detection

Sobel edge detection

Laplacian edge detection

Watershed segmentation

Face detection (Haar cascades)

Blob detection

Advanced Processing

Binary thresholding

Morphological gradient

Entropy filter

SLIC superpixels

Optical flow visualization

Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-image

SciPy

Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

Install requirements with:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image scipy

Usage
Place your image in a directory accessible to the script

Modify the last line of the script to point to your image file:
visualize_image_features(r'path/to/your/image.jpg')

Run the script:
python feature_detection.py

Output
The script will display a 4x5 grid of visualizations showing different features extracted from your input image. The plot automatically adjusts to your screen size for optimal viewing.

Customization
You can modify:

The figure size by adjusting the fig_width and fig_height calculations

The feature visualizations by editing the plot_feature calls

The processing parameters for each feature detection method

Notes
The script handles both color and grayscale processing automatically

Some features (like face detection) require specific trained models (included with OpenCV)

The optical flow visualization uses a synthetic translation for demonstration purposes
